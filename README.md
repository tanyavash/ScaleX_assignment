# Task for Backend Engineer Intern

## Overview 
This repository encapsulates the completion of the Backend Engineer Intern Task, comprising two main components: API Development and Integration and Database Management.

## API Development and Integration
Successfully developed a RESTful API to retrieve price and volume data from the sample database. The API has endpoints that work well to get and check the data, and it can handle errors effectively.

## Database Management
For the Database Management aspect, A MongoDB Atlas cluster was set up and a schema was designed specifically for the sample dataset. Implemented CRUD operations using Mongoose to interact smoothly with the database. 


## Completion
The tasks were completed diligently, following the outlined requirements and guidelines. Comprehensive testing was carried out to verify the functionality and accuracy of both API endpoints and database operations.
